Hereâ€™s a basic `README` for your **Attendo App**:

# Attendo App

**Attendo** is a Django-based web application designed to track attendance at various stations or locations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Django
- MySQL Database
- `Pillow` for image handling:  
  ```bash
  pip install Pillow
  ```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendo.git
   ```

2. **Configure your Database**:  
   Set up MySQL database and update `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

3. **Update Frontpage**:  
   In `home.html` under the `frontpage` app, change the `img` tag to point to your `images` folder. You can also replace the default image with your own.

4. **Add Stations**:  
   The **Station** app doesn't have a UI. To add stations, use the Django admin panel.

## Usage

1. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Create an attendance record for a user by entering their details.
   - The **Time In** is automatically recorded when the attendance is created.
   - The **Time Out** is recorded when you click **Done** at the end of the shift.

2. **Generate Reports**:  
   Generate CSV reports by specifying a date range.

## Notes
- Make sure you configure your database and static files properly.
- The system tracks time and attendance at various stations and generates reports for review.
